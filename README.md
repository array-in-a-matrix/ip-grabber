# IP Grabber
Logs the client IPv4 address and redirects them to a target website using Node.js.

The grabber will redirect the client to the first commandline argument (a link or IP) if it exists. Otherwise, it will use the default link defined in the code. A Node.js server will be hosted on port 3030 when script is running.
